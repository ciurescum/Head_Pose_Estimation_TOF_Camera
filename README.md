# Head_Pose_Estimation_TOF_Camera

This project estimates the head position by calculating the head rotation angles: pitch, raw, yaw. The algorithm was tested on video samples generated by a TOF Camera.
This type of camera gives a 3D coordonate for every point in the image. The depth information provided by the ToF camera can usually be converted to depth maps(containts spatial coordinates (x, y), associated with depth information (z)). In this project the depth maps processed in MatLab were combined to obtain a full 3D head model.
This head model was then used in the algorithm to determine 8 facial landmarks(nose center, eye corners, lip corners, tip of the chin). Using these points, the program computed the pitch, roll and yaw angles. 
To validate my algorithm, I used a public adnotated database BIWI Kinect HeadPose.
